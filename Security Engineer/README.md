## Exam Guide Breakdown
The follow section we will breakdown the exam guide into areas of study.

### 1. Configuring access within a cloud solution environment

#### 1.1 Configuring Cloud Identity. Considerations include:

* Managing Cloud Identity
* Configuring Google Cloud Directory Sync
* Management of super administrator account

##### Cloud Identity

Cloud Identity is an Identity as a Service (IDaaS) and enterprise mobility management (EMM) product. It offers the identity services and endpoint administration that are available in G Suite as a stand-alone product. As an administrator, you can use Cloud Identity to manage your users, apps, and devices from a central locationâ€”the Google Admin console.

There are free and premium editions of Cloud Identity. [Compare the differences](https://support.google.com/cloudidentity/answer/7431902)

**If you're a G Suite admin**
* G Suite licenses are required only for users who need certain G Suite services, like Gmail. To manage users who don't need any G Suite services, you can create free Cloud Identity accounts for them.  
* In most cases, Cloud Identity Free edition users have the same identity services as G Suite users, such as single sign-on (SSO) and 2-Step Verification (2SV).

**If you're a GCP admin**
* Consumer accounts, such as personal Gmail accounts or consumer accounts with work email IDs, are unmanaged accounts and are outside of your control. If developers in your organization use unmanaged accounts to use GCP resources, you can create Cloud Identity accounts to manage these users.
* You can create free Cloud Identity accounts for each user, separate from paid G Suite accounts. By doing so, you can manage all users across your entire domain from the Google Admin console.
* Cloud Identity Free edition provides common identity services, such as SSO.

You can manage Cloud Identity via the [REST API](https://cloud.google.com/identity/docs/reference/rest)

_Cloud Identity APIs_
* [Groups API](https://cloud.google.com/identity/docs/groups)
  * Allows you to create and manage different types of groups, each of which supports different features, as well as their memberships.

Google Recommends leveraging there [Client Libraries](https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/client-libraries-explained) in order to interact with there APIs.

#### Identity and access management (IAM)

Identity and access management (IAM) is the practice of granting the right individuals access to the right resources for the right reasons. This series explores IAM and the individuals who are subject to it, including the following:

* **Corporate identities**: The identities that you manage for employees of your organization. These identities are used for signing in to workstations, accessing email, or using corporate applications. Corporate identities might also include non-employees such as contractors or partners that need access to corporate resources.
* **Customer identities**: The identities that you manage for users in order to interact with your website or customer-facing applications.
* **Service identities**: The identities that you manage in order to enable applications to interact with other applications or the underlying platform.

You might need to grant access to the following resources:
* Google services such as Google Cloud, Google Analytics, or G Suite
* Resources in Google Cloud, such as projects, Cloud Storage buckets, or virtual machines (VMs)
* Custom applications or resources managed by such applications

#### Managing Customer Identities

Customer identities are the identities that you manage for users to let them interact with your website or customer-facing applications. Managing customer identities and their access is also referred to as customer identity and access management (CIAM).

By leveraging Google's [Identity Platfrom](https://cloud.google.com/identity-platform) you can control access to your business application. It provides Single-Sign-On (SSO) capabilities. This is done by building [authentication workflows](https://cloud.google.com/identity-platform/docs/concepts-authentication) into the application using easy-to-use SDK functionality.

#### Google Cloud Directory and Directory Sync
